# Seed-File-Generator

## About
This script uses Tarkov-Market along with our proxy (to hide the API key) to generate a seed file which contains all of the items in the game.

## Usage
You need to have Nodejs installed on your system (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) along with NPM. In order to use the script, download a .zip of the repository or clone it with GIT and then run ``npm install`` from inside of the directory. This will grab all of the dependencies from NPM. Then simply open CMD in the same directory as the file ``createSeedFile.js`` and run ``node createSeedFile.js`` this *should* create a seed file and place it on your desktop. The script will output "DONE" when it is finished. You can then close the CMD window and use your new seed file with your editor of choice!
